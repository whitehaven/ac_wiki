# Purpose of wiki
I'm not sure I should even do this. It may be a waste of time, but I like the idea of it being so granular as text files for things that can be text files. Thd online services all own the data and they could go away and take everything. I'm going to see if it is good using only my informatics projects. We'll go from there. Or not.


Feel free to profit from my research! I hope to use this as an annotated notebook, though it may end up being more simple than that. You can't beat plain text.
